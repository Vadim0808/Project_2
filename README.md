# Project_2
In this project, I will be addressing a classification task using the K-means algorithm, based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables. 
This means I will utilize variables such as purchase frequency, recency, and the total sum of purchases. 
The data comprises a transnational dataset containing all transactions that occurred from January 12, 2010, to September 12, 2011, for a UK-based online retail business that is not a store-front. 
The dataset is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail.
